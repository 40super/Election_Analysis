## Election-Audit Summary
The Election_Analysis Script can be used for many other elections as well with slight modification. One modificatipn that can be useful is to output the statistical information on a csv file. The reason this modification can be useful is that you are able to compare multiple elections and understand what are some influences can candidates used to achieve the win. Another modification to the script is to gather more informatoin from csv if the csv files have more columns of information. Using libraries like pandas can help with that and provide more versatile support.
